#### How to Run the Program

1. **Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) is Installed**:

   - Ensure that your system has the Java Development Kit installed, as it is necessary to compile and run Java applications.

2. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal**:

   - Open your command line interface, such as Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS or Linux.

3. **Compile the Java File**:
